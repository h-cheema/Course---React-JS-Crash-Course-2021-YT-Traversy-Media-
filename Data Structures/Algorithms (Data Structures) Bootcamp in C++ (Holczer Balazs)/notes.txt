Algorithms (Data Structures) Bootcamp in C++


Section 2: Algorithms - Recursion

    2. What are stack and heap memory?
    - Both are their own specific regions on RAM. Data types are stack and heap.
    - Stack: small, fast access, stores func calls and local vars, no fragmentation.
        - LIFO - last in first out.
    - Heap: large, slow access, stores objects, can become fragmented.
        - FIFO - first in first out.
    
    4. What is recursion (recursive function call)?
    - Recursion is one of the central computer science ideas.
    - We can transform recursion into iteration and back.
    - Recursion is very elegant.
    - Base cases are used to avoid infinite loops.
    - Head and tail recursion:
        - Tail: recursive call is at end of function. Similar to a for loop.
        - Head: recursive call is at the start of the function. method saves state, requiring more memory.
