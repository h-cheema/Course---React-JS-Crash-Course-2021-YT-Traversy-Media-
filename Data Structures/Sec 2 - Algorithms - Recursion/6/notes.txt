Algorithms (Data Structures) Bootcamp in C++


Section 2: Algorithms - Recursion

    2. What are stack and heap memory?
    - Both are their own specific regions on RAM. Data types are stack and heap.
    - Stack: small, fast access, stores func calls and local vars, no fragmentation.
        - LIFO - last in first out.
    - Heap: large, slow access, stores objects, can become fragmented.
        - FIFO - first in first out.
    
    4. What is recursion (recursive function call)?
    - Recursion is one of the central computer science ideas.
    - We can transform recursion into iteration and back.
    - Recursion is very elegant.
    - Base cases are used to avoid infinite loops.
    - Head and tail recursion:
        - Tail: recursive call is at end of function. Similar to a for loop.
        - Head: recursive call is at the start of the function. method saves state, requiring more memory.

    6. Recursion and stack memory (stack overflow)
    - Function calls and values are stored on the stack.
    - Head recursion may cause stack overflow.
    - Tail recursion uses an accumulator to track current result.
        - There are no unknown variables. 
        - Return result when hitting the base case.
        - Get rid of previous frame each call because value is being stored in a variable.

    7. Factorial problem
    - Head recursion does not know the base case. It calls through itself until n = 1 and uses itself as a parameter with the next case.
    - Tail recursion stores the "result so far" in an accumulator variable. Head recursion calls itself until (n = 1) is reached.
