Section 2: Basics (19min)

    4. What is JavaScript and how does it change?
    - Ecma tc39 is committee that decides javascript's specifications.
    - Anyone can make a proposal for tc39 on github.
        - That proposal goes through stages of acceptance.
    - ECMAScript goes by version. ES6 is also ES2015.
    - "caniuse.com" shows which browsers suppoert which features.
    - Js is 100% backwards compatible. Modern code will always work in the future.
    - You should know how the old features that the new ones are built on work.
    
    5. What is compilations vs polyfilling?
    - Compile new code into primitive code for older browsers. ex: babel.
    - Polyfill includes a file that is used in old browser to be used.

    6. What is "use strict" and what does it do?
    > Strict mode -> strict operating context.
        - makes debugging easier.
        - put "use strict" string at top of the file to use it.
        - putting "use strict" at top of function impl makes it strict mode 
        - Variables must be declared with keyword. 
            - Prevents spelling mistakes when reassigning values.
            - Prevents globals
        - Does not let you delete functions or args for functions.
        - Does not let eval("var a = 1") leak variable a.

    7. Does javascript pass variables by reference or by value?
    - Prims are passed by value. Objects are passed by reference.
        - Cannot change passed value in outer scope.

    8. What are the rest operators?
    - Js functions ignore extra parameters by default
    - Within a function, there is a collection/structure (not an array) of all arguements called "arguements".
        - func(1,2,3) {Array.prototype.slice.call(arguements, 1);} was work around before.
    - "function(...options){}" options is an array.
        - "function(arg, ...options){}" arg is first arguement, options has the rest of args (rest operator).
    
    9. What is the spread operator?
    - "var ar1 = [4,5,6];"
    - "var ar2 = [1,2,3, ...ar1];" adds each element.
    - Better than adding array directly as an element (becomes MD array).
    - console.log(method, ...opts) opts array spreads out individual vars.
    - USE CASES: copying arrays, manipulating arrays, explode arguements into a func that takes mult args
    
    10. What are template strings?
    - `string` includes literally everything, even new lines.
    - `${name}` prints name var
    - Makes code easier to understand.
    - `${1 + 4}`; will do math.
    - `${condition ? runTrue : runFalse}`

    11. What are template string tags?
    - example: console.log(h1`hello ${placeVar} my name is ${nameVar}`);


Section 3: Types & Equality (22min)
    13. What are the different types in JavaScript?
    - dynamically typed (liked js) variables types are determined at runtime
        - quick development
    - statically typed (like java) variables types are determined at compile time
        - catch errors before compiling
    - js engine uses "undefined" for either uninitialized var, missing parameter, unknown property from a list
        - only js engine sets "undefined" but never "null"
        - only a programmer sets "null" but never "undefined"
        - "undefined" is a type
        - undefined == null = true because value is the same. type is not, so undefined === null = false
        - null's type is null but js incorrectly reports it as type "object"
    
    14. What is the difference between == and ===?
    - == means equality (checks value)
        - js tries to convert values to same type, like 0 and '0'. both convert to 0.
            - called "type coercion" (the rules for this are very specific and hard to remember)
            >> equality table https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/
    - === means strict equality (checks type and value)
        - always returns false if type is different. both type and value need to be same.

    15. What is NaN and how can we check for it?
    - NaN is of type number
    - Results in a number that isn't a valid number
    - NaN == NaN = false. 1 == NaN = false.
    - isNaN(1) = false. isNaN("1") = false. isNaN("A") = true.
        - implicit coercion
    - How to check for NaN: Check equality to itself with ==
    - NaN == to anything is always false, even NaN == NaN
