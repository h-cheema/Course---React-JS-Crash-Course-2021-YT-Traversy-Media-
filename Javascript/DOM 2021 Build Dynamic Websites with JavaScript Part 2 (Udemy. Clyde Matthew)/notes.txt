Section 1: Introduction to Events

    1. Introduction - what is an event
    - An event is an action a user or browser has taken.
        - hover over an element.
        - clicking a button.
        - submitting a form.
        - page finishes loading.
    - Events take place in the browser itself, given to use by the DOM API. 
    - Events are not unique to JS
    - DOM changes in the console are only temporary. Refreshes removes changes.

    - A) Event listeners:
        - Responsive interface to a listener on an element.

            - inline event listener.
            - inline properties.
            - event listeners.
    - B) Event handlers:
        - every event needs a handler.
        - Listeners listen for an event firing.
        - Handlers respond to fired event.
