Section 1: Introduction to Events - hr 4min

    1. Introduction - what is an event
    - An event is an action a user or browser has taken.
        - hover over an element.
        - clicking a button.
        - submitting a form.
        - page finishes loading.
    - Events take place in the browser itself, given to use by the DOM API. 
    - Events are not unique to JS
    - DOM changes in the console are only temporary. Refreshes removes changes.
    
    3. The 2 most important things when it comes to events
    - A) Event listeners:
        - Responsive interface to a listener on an element.
        - three types of event listeners.
            - inline event listener.
            - inline properties.
            - event listeners.
    - B) Event handlers:
        - every event needs a handler.
        - Listeners listen for an event firing.
        - Handlers respond to fired event.
    - There are many different types of events.

    5. Inline Event Listeners - brief introduction
    - boom() is an inline listener here: <button onclick="boom()"></button>

    6. Do we need to wrap our attribute values in quotation marks?
    - Some attributes dont need quotation marks.
        - Quotations only needed when there are spaces, special characters: ` ' " < > =
    
    10. Summary - the 3 ways to add an event listener to HTML elements
    - All ways to add event listeners work. 
    - addEventListener() is the best way for organization and capabilities.

    14. Inline Event Listeners - detailed overview
    - Inline event listeners are undesirable.
        - You should separate your html from JS.
        - If you have 100 buttons you have to change 100 elements manually.
        - More maintainable to use script listeners.

    17. Inline Event Listeners - TEST solution (part 3 of 3)
    - onclick="handle()"
        - onclick = listener
        - handle() = handler

    18. Inline Properties - detailed overview
    - Event listeners are properties attached html elements.

    23. addEventListener() method - detailed overview
    - addEventListener() is from the DOM API, not js.
        - Default APIs: Fetch(), Websockets, File System, History API
    - element.addEventListener(event, callback)
