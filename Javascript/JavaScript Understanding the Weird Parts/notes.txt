Section 1: Getting Started - 15min

    1. Introduction and The Goal of This Course
    - js is nothing like other similar looking languages, such as java or c++
        - js is a different paradigm than those languages.
    - js is deceptively powerful and beautiful.
    - Philosophy: Don't immitate. Understand.
        - Don't immitate js code.
        - Immitation -> When you have to debug or make code from scratch, you will have major problems.
    
    5. Understanding, Frameworks, and The Weird Parts
    - When you learn js through JQuery and Node, you don't get a deep understanding of js.
    - You should build a very strong core js skillset first.
    - Understanding weird parts = Understanding the hows and whys.
