- = note, * = research this


Part 1
- JSX is not a templating language.
- map keys only need to be unique in each list, not the whole app.
    - { this.state.tags.map(tag => <li key={tag}>{tag}</li>) }
- true && 'hi' && 1 will return 1 becase it's the last operand
- using an arrow function doesn't rebind 'this', they inherit it
    - cleaner and more efficient
    - better than making a constructor and and super call to rebind each even handler manually


Part 2
* Composing components
    - passing data
    - raise and handle events
    - multiple components in sync
    - functional components
    - lifecycle
- React is a tree of components
- props are read only. react does not let you change them.
    - can be modified in state.
