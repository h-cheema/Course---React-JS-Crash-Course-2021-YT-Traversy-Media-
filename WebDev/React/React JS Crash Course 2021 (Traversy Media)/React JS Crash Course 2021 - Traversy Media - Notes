INTRO
    1:00 What is React
    - SPA single page app
    - Can be made a full stack app with MERN stack
    - React is a library more than a framework

    3:40 Why use React?
    - Components hold state and data, each is dynamic
    - Huge in industry, easier to work on it with teams
    - Good performance and good debugging

    6:10 What to know first?
    - Async code, promises
    - Array methods in js
    - Fetch API, HTTP requests

    8:50 Components vs Classes
    - Components made with classes or functions
    - Focus is on function comps with hooks

    10:10 working with state
    - Obj that determines how a comp behaves and renders
    - App or global state available to whole UI

    11:30 React Hooks
    - functions that let you hook into states of components


CREATE REACT APP
    - JSX - Class = className
        - for becomes htmlFor
    - component return has to be one element, such as a div with everything in it.
    - to use a component you must import react
    - state gets passed down, actions get passed up
    - mock node server called "json server"
    - import useEffect deals with side effects like when the page loads
    - when using Route, make sure to use "Link" and "to" instead of "<a>" and "href".
